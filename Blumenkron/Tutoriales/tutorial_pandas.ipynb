Many machine learning algorithms and statistical models require numerical inputs. Categorical variables, which represent qualitative data, need to be transformed into numerical values to be used effectively in these algorithms. Additionally, if categorical data is left in its original form without encoding, some algorithms might misinterpret the data as ordinal (having a meaningful order) when there's actually no inherent order. For example, if you have categories like \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" and \"Green,\" encoding them as 0, 1, and 2 could wrongly imply an ordinal relationship, leading to incorrect interpretations. Finally, encodings can also help save resources (numerical values take up less space than text labels), plus they can also assist in handling missing values.\n","\n","There are several methods for encoding categorical variables, each with its own advantages and considerations. Common encoding techniques include one-hot encoding (creating binary columns for each category), label encoding (assigning unique integers to categories), and target encoding (using target variable information to encode categories).\n","\n","For our movie data, it would be advisable to encode the `genres` column into categorical values.
